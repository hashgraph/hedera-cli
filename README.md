# Hedera CLI

This is a simple quick start tool to understand the apis via gRPC that Hedera platform provides.

To get started, you must either have a **`mainnet`** or a **`testnet`** account.

You can register at [portal.hedera.com](https://portal.hedera.com) to get an *account*, or get another user who already has an account to create one for you.

A *Hedera account* is represented in a numeric format, delimited by 2 dots. For example `0.0.1234`. The first number in this example "0" represents the shard number. The second number "0" represents the realm number and the last number "1234" is the account number.

## Overview

Hedera currently has 3 services.
1) Crypto service
2) File service
3) Smart contract service

and an upcoming 4th service - Hedera consensus service.

To read what Hedera has to offer, you can check out

1) [docs.hedera.com](https://docs.hedera.com/docs)

### Commands

#### Setup operator account

There is the concept of an operator account where the operator can pay for the transaction costs, ie network and node fees.

Cli will prompt `setup` on first run to save default operator key into `~/.hedera`. You will need to have an accountID and 24 words ready.
AccountGetInfo is called during setup to confirm the account exists. This will cost some tinybars.
 
The default operator can be changed anytime by using `account use 0.0.xxxx`.
```bash
# Sets the default operator
setup
```

#### Switch to a specific network

```bash
# To see the list of available networks
network ls

# To change network
network use mainnet
network use testnet
```
#### List Accounts

```bash
# Lists all accounts associated with current network
account ls
```

#### Switch Accounts
```bash
# Switch to use any account that has been recovered and exists in `account ls`
account use 0.0.xxxx
```

#### Default Accounts (v0.1.3)
The account must have been recovered and exists in `account ls`
```bash
# Sets the account as default operator. 
account default 0.0.xxxx
```

#### Recover Accounts

```bash
# Recovering a Hedera account using 24 recovery words, where words are separated by spaces. This is default.
account recovery 0.0.xxxx
```

#### Create Account

Account creation can be done in multiple ways.

Simple Key
1) Creating an account using new recovery words and keypair.
2) Creating an account using operator's keypair.
3) Creating an account using any public key.

MultiSig account creation (not yet supported)

```bash
# Creates a new Hedera account using NEW recovery words and keypair. This is default.
account create -b 100000000

# Creates a new Hedera account using Operator's public key 
account create -b 100000000 -k
```

#### Delete Account
Cli will prompt for key of account that is set for deletion. 
Only the account for deletion can sign the transaction.
```bash
# Deletes an account from Hedera, and transfers the remaining funds from the deleted account to the new account
account delete -o 0.0.1001 -n 0.0.1002
account delete --oldAccount 0.0.1001 --newAccount 0.0.1002
```
#### Account Balance

```bash
# Gets the balance of an account
account balance 0.0.xxxx
```

#### Account Get Info
Gets the information of an account, such as the public keys, and stateproofs (upcoming)
```bash
# Gets the information of an account
account info 0.0.xxxx
```

#### Account Update (v0.1.3)
Cli will prompt for original key as well as the new key that said account will be updated with.
```bash
# Updated the keypair of account
account info 0.0.xxxx 
```

#### Help

```bash
# shows all the available commands
help
```
